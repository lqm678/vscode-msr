## [1.0.5]

- Skipped sorting and removing lower score results when finding references.

- Update `extra search path` descriptions in configuration file.
- Support both with or without `-I` in command line: output summary to stdout or stderr.
- Default menu `Find All References` will not search extra paths (disabled in configuration as default).
- Added `msr.disable.extensionPatterns`: Regex pattern of file extensions to disable `find definition and references`.
- Improved sorting results.

## [1.0.3]
